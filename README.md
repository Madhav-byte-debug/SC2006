# SC2006 Software Engineering

Lab TA: DON SIMAN PATABANDI AMASHI NIWARTHANA	AMASHINI001@e.ntu.edu.sg

The team project extends over the whole semester and will contribute 50% of the assessment of this course. Your project team will have 5 scheduled laboratory sessions* starting either in week 2 or week 3 depending whether your lab sessions are in even weeks.

## Grading Criteria
Without a team, you will get ZERO marks for the course project.

Missing two lab sessions without acceptable documented reason will result in ZERO marks for the course project.

Your team project will be graded as follows:
Assessment of Lab#1, Lab#2, and Lab#3 deliverables (15%)
Live demo of the working application prototype that fulfills the requirements (20%)
Completeness and correctness of final documentations + Effective use of good software engineering principles, architecture, and designs (15%)
In Lab#2, Lab#3 , and Lab#4, your lab supervisor will evaluate your progress against the required deliverables of the preceding lab session. This accounts for 15% (5% for each assessment) of the final course mark. The lab supervisor will also provide suggestions and comments for the improvement of your documentation and design.

You must work in a team ( 4 -6 members in the same lab session). Teams will be determined during the first Lab Session. No change in team membership is allowed without good cause the approval of the Lab Supervisor .  

Each team member must contribute to 4 different types of work products (can be shared with team-mates) throughout the project. This means everybody must actively participate in the entire SDLC of the project. After the project demo, each team member is required to submit his/her peer-reviews of his/her teammates. The typical types of work in the project are the following:
Use Case Model (Use Case Diagram and Use Case Descriptions)
Class Diagrams (Including conceptual model)
Sequence Diagrams
State Machine Diagrams
Documentation (Software Requirements Specifcation SRS)
Design Model
Source Code (Project application implementation)
Test Cases

Your individual project mark will be determined by the formula:
 
(team_mark) * (individual_contributions_weight)
 
individual_contributions_weight is a factor ranging [0, 1] depending on peer reviews.


Here are some advice:
Start early, proceed iteratively 
Take immediate actions on lab supervisor's comments
Distribute tasks fairly among team members
Make good use of different expertise of team members
Address collaboration issues as early as possible (come to talk with us if you feel necessary)
